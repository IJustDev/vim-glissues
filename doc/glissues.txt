INTRODUCTION                                                       *glissues*

You want to access gitlab issues from within vim? With this plugin you can
access your issues. They are listed in a new buffer, but it requires vim
version 8 and curl.

COMMANDS                                                  *glissues-commands*

|:GLOpenIssues|         Opens your open issues in a new buffer. Provided
                      details are issue id (used for closing and commenting to
                      issues via commit), title and description.

|:GLOpenIssuesExt|      Same as |:GLOpenIssues| but loads comments, too. This
                      will take some time.

ABOUT                                                        *glissues-about*
