INTRODUCTION                                                       *glissues*

You want to access gitlab issues from within vim? With this plugin you can
access your issues. They are listed in a new buffer, but it requires vim
version 8 (json stuff) and curl.

COMMANDS                                                  *glissues-commands*

|:GLOpenIssues|         Opens your open issues in a new buffer. Provided
                      details are issue id (used for closing and commenting to
                      issues via commit), title and description.

|:GLOpenIssuesExt|      Same as |:GLOpenIssues| but loads comments, too. This
                      will take some time.

|:GLClosedIssues[Ext]|  Like the commands |:GLOpenIssues| and |:GLOpenIssuesExt|,
                      loads and shows closed issues.

|:GLNewIssue|           Opens a new window with a form. You can fill in the
                      form and save this data to the server with |:GLSave|.

ABOUT                                                        *glissues-about*
